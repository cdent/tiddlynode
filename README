A stab at making a TiddlyWeb under node.js. With several constraints
that may change over time:

* HTTP API only. 
* JSON only, no other serializations (no HTML!).
* No support for authentication or authorization, meaning no
  users and no polices.
* No support for revisions.
* The author has no clue what he's doing and is winging it.

It does not work yet. Some routes are not yet mapped to handlers
that work. There are issues with asynchronous handling. There needs
to be a sense of object for the main entities. These probably ought
to be EventEmitters, or there should be a notion of a StorageInterface
which is an emitter. The lack of clear separation between handlers,
entities, and persistence is a problem right now for making clear
code and understanding how the system works.

Things hoping to explore:

* proper asynchrony

Run it by doing:

   node app.js

This will start a server running at port 8000.

Entities are stored in the current directory:

* foo.recipe files as JSON.
* foo.bag directories contain a 'description' file and a tiddlers
  directory.
* tiddlers are saved as files by title, JSON on disk.

A convenient way to test it is to use the test_urlmap.py
and http_runner.py files from the Python TiddlyWeb distribution.
